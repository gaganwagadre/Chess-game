# Chess-game


Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured ("in check") and there is no legal move to escape.

The game starts with white moving first, followed by black. Pieces move in distinct patterns: pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, bishops move diagonally, rooks move horizontally or vertically, the queen moves any number of squares in any direction, and the king moves one square in any direction.

Players strategically develop their pieces to control the board, attack the opponent, and defend their own pieces. Key concepts include control of the center, piece coordination, and pawn structure. Special moves include castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

The game can end in checkmate, stalemate, resignation, or draws by agreement, insufficient material, the fifty-move rule, or threefold repetition. Chess requires deep thinking, foresight, and adaptability, making it a timeless game of skill and intellect.
